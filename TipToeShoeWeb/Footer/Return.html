                                for returned items not received if registered post is not used.
                            </p>

                                the shoe box, where
                                applicable) which must be in the original condition; and</p>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 35px;">HOW CAN I REQUEST A RETURN OR REFUND?</h3>
                            <p style="font-size: 25px;"> We provide an easy to use returns system for you to request
                                your return! You only require two pieces of information to request your return:</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Order ID # (can be found in your confirmation email)</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Email address used to place the original order
                                Click to request your return: <a href="Request.html" style="color: gray;">REQUEST
                                    RETURN</a></p>

                            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Our customer support team will get back to you with your return
                                parcel details & return authorisation slip. The item packaging including a shoe box, if
                                relevant is just as important as the items or shoes themselves, so please do not alter
                                or damage in anyway – e.g. do not attach shipping forms, tape or mark the box. Doing so
                                can result in your return being invalid. Shoes cannot be returned for change of mind
                                with scratched or dirty soles. We suggest you try them on for the first time on carpet
                                to ensure they are in perfect condition. We will not take responsibility for returned
                                items not received if registered post is not used.

                                items. The exclusion will be noted on the relevant product page on our website. For all
                                items marked FINAL SALE, unfortunately we do not offer refunds or exchanges for change
